In a world where swords and sorcery reign supreme, magick is not only the essential of the world but also driving unlimited possibilities. "Mages" must first understand fundamental spells before they can delve into more advanced realms of magick.  
The concept of progression and hierarchy is akin to the mathematical theory of Poset(partially ordered set). This concept provides a systematic to approach the secrets of magick. Who learn this system are known as "PosetMage."

However, to unleash the true potential power of magick, a deeper exploration of the "Lattice" theory is necessary. Lattice is a specialized poset, encapsulating the possibilities of hybrid magick, much like an interlaced grid where each node represents a unique combination to enchant. A mage capable of casting multiple magicks simultaneously is called a "LatticeMage."

Master sorcerers, referred to as "All Integration Mages" or "AI-Mages," can fully grasp existing spells and innovate new spell.

We hope that everyone with a zest for exploration can become the AI-Mage of your own life.
