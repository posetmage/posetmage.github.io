*I do not remember making that decision. This life, it chose me.*  
<p align="right"><i>−−Ezio</i></p>


Leader of [Mages](/About). In my previous life, I was an elf aged 314, working as a bard and painter. After unexpectedly hit by a truck, I was reincarnated into this world, with faint memories of [origin world](/Novel/SettingBook) I once knew.

In this new world, I continue my journey as a wandering [artist](https://www.facebook.com/LatticeMage), never abandoning my quest to return to my original world. I often delve into various ACGN realms, seeking any hint that could lead me back. To equip myself for this journey, I've accumulated vast [knowledge](https://notes.posetmage.com) across numerous domains.

Recently, I've discovered the origin of mana, prompting my transition into becoming an AI-Mage.
